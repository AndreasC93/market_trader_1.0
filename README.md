## Proposal
We will pull SPY, QQQ, GLD, and UUP from the alpaca api. We will use kraken's api to pull in btc data. First we will calculate a moving average and use cluster analysis to define buy/sell signals. Based on the results we will choose machine learning models and compare profitability/efficiency of the various models.
